UpstreamA
=========

This is the UpstreamA package of the cmake tutorial for multi module setups.

The UpstreamA package provides a libraries that just print
some Hello World strings:
* lib: example upstream library

This package needs the Base package (incl. Component A).

This project is configured with CMake.

Build
-----

Use your prefered way working with CMake.
Recommended out-of-source build.

You can choose to build the library static or shared
by setting BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF or ON.

Install
-------

To install everything from this package build the target install.

This package contains a couple of install components:
* Runtime: group needed to use the libraries at runtime (shared libraries)
** Lib: is required and always installed
* Development: group needed to use the libraries at development time (headers, cmake-files, static-libraries).
** UpstreamADevel: Basic cmake-files to use this package (CONFIG)
** LibDevel: dev files for the lib library

You can install components at own risks (beware of dependencies) with

    cmake -DCOMPONENT=Core -P <path-to-base-build-dir>/cmake_install.cmake

Prefer to use CPack:

    cpack -G TGZ

produces two archives one for the Runtime Components and
one for the Development components.
Install these tar files.

Or use a CPack Generator that is multi component aware like NSIS or PackageMaker
to select the desired components in a graphical insterface.
