MyApp1
======

This is the MyApp1 package of the cmake tutorial for multi module setups.

The MyApp1 package provides an executable that just prints some
Hello World strings.
This package is needs the UpstreamA library.

This project is configured with CMake.

Build
-----

Use your prefered way working with CMake.
Recommended out-of-source build.

Depending on your choice how the dependend libraries are build
(static or shared) the xecutable will be linked accordingly.

Install
-------

To install everything from this package build the target install.

This package contains a couple of install components:
* Runtime: group needed to use the executable at runtime
** MyApp: The executable.
* Development: group to find the executable at development time (cmake-files).
** MyApp1Devel: Basic cmake-files to use this package (CONFIG)
** MyAppDevel: dev files for myapp1 executable

[NOTE]
.Development
The development group becomes handy when the apps provides own libraries 
as well (e.g. for Plugin Dev.). Or when the executable is a generator / compiler
that is mainly used within other cmake files.

You can install components at own risks (beware of dependencies) with

    cmake -DCOMPONENT=MyApp -P <path-to-base-build-dir>/cmake_install.cmake

Prefer to use CPack:

    cpack -G TGZ

produces two archives one for the Runtime Components and 
one for the Development components.
Install these tar files.

Or use a CPack Generator that is multi component aware like NSIS or PackageMaker
to select the desired components in a graphical insterface.
