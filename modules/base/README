This is the base package of the cmake tutorial for multi module setups.

The base package provides 3 libraries that all just print some Hello World strings:
* core: example core library
* adapterA: example adapter library for an imaginary interface A
* adapterB: example adapter library for an imaginary interface B

This project is configured with CMake.

Build
-----

Use your prefered way working with CMake.
Recommended out-of-source build.

You can choose to build the libraries static or shared by setting BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF or ON.

Install
-------

To install everything from this package build the target install.

This package contains a couple of install components:
* Runtime: group needed to use the libraries at runtime (shared libraries)
** Core: is required and always installed
** A: installs library for adapter A
** B: installs library for adapter B
* Development: group needed to use the libraries at development time (headers, cmake-files, static-libraries).
** BaseDevel: Basic cmake-files to use this package (CONFIG)
** CoreDevel: dev files for core library
** ADevel: dev files for adapter A library
** BDevel: dev files for adapter B library

You can install components at own risks (beware of dependencies) with

    cmake -DCOMPONENT=Core -P <path-to-base-build-dir>/cmake_install.cmake

Prefer to use CPack:

    cpack -G TGZ

produces two archives one for the Runtime Components and one for the Development components.
Install these tar files.

Or use a CPack Generator that is multi component aware like NSIS or PackageMaker to select the desired components in a graphical insterface.
